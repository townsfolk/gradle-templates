## Introduction

The Gradle Templates plugin helps you get started using Gradle by providing convenient tasks for creating new projects that work with the Gradle build system. Eg. To create a new Java project you can run:

	gradle createJavaProject

Which will prompt you for your new project's name and create a new directory with it. It will also create a standard directory structure in your project's directory that works with Gradle's default configurations.

The plugin also makes it easy to create your own templates which can be useful in creating new projects, or creating components within your projects. Eg. It's easy to create a simple task to generate a new GSP that fits your company's standard layout. Or to create a more complex task to generate a new servlet and add the entry into your webapp's web.xml file.

Current Version: 1.3

## Installation
### Binaries

To install the plugin with Gradle M3 and above you should use the apply script provided on the [Github website](https://github.com/townsfolk/gradle-templates).

To use the apply script, add this to your `build.gradle` file:

	apply from: 'http://www.tellurianring.com/projects/gradle-plugins/gradle-templates/1.3/apply.groovy'

You can use the 'latest' apply script to automatically get updated when there are new releases.

	apply from: 'http://www.tellurianring.com/projects/gradle-plugins/gradle-templates/apply.groovy'

This apply script will always point to the latest release available.
### Installing from source

Build the plugin:

	cd gradle-templates
	gradle build

In your project, use the apply script that is found under the installation directory.

	apply from: 'file:///[gradle-templates]/installation/apply-local.groovy'
	
You also need to set two properties in your `gradle.properties` file, or supply them via System properties.

	gradle.templates.dir=[gradle-templates]
	gradle.templates.ver=[version]
	
Note that the version property should be equal to version found in `[gradle-templates]/gradle.properties`

### Alternate Installation from Source

You can also build and install the plugin locally from a maven repo by building the plugin:

	cd gradle-templates
	gradle build install
	
In your project, add the following to load the plugin from your maven repo:

	import templates.*

	apply plugin: 'maven'

	buildscript {
		repositories {
			mavenCentral()
			mavenLocal()
		}
		dependencies {
			classpath group: 'gradle-templates', name:'gradle-templates', version: '1.4'
		}
	}
	apply plugin: 'templates'

Now, you should be able to add your own templates as shown below without the need for the other configuration options.

## Usage

Entering `gradle tasks` will show you the available `Templates` tasks:

	Template tasks
	--------------
	createGradlePlugin - Creates a new Gradle Plugin project in a new directory named after your project.
	createGroovyClass - Creates a new Groovy class in the current project.
	createGroovyProject - Creates a new Gradle Groovy project in a new directory named after your project.
	createJavaClass - Creates a new Java class in the current project.
	createJavaProject - Creates a new Gradle Java project in a new directory named after your project.
	createScalaClass - Creates a new Scala class in the current project.
	createScalaObject - Creates a new Scala object in the current project.
	createScalaProject - Creates a new Gradle Scala project in a new directory named after your project.
	createWebappProject - Creates a new Gradle Webapp project in a new directory named after your project.
	initGradlePlugin - Initializes a new Gradle Plugin project in the current directory.
	initGroovyProject - Initializes a new Gradle Groovy project in the current directory.
	initJavaProject - Initializes a new Gradle Java project in the current directory.
	initScalaProject - Initializes a new Gradle Scala project in the current directory.
	initWebappProject - Initializes a new Gradle Webapp project in the current directory.

The main difference between the `create*Project` and `init*Project` tasks is that the `create` tasks end up creating a new directory for your new project, and the `init` tasks will create the default directory structure under the current directory.

Eg. Running `createGroovyProject` will prompt you for your new project's name:

	[10:48:18 elberry@pulse:~/development/projects]
	[543] gradle createGroovyProject
	> Building > :createGroovyProject
	?> Project Name: TestGroovyProject
	:createGroovyProject
	
	BUILD SUCCESSFUL

and create a directory like:

	TestGroovyProject
		/src
			/main
				/groovy
				/resources
			/test
				/groovy
				/resources

Running the `initGroovyProject` task will generate the default `groovy project` directory structure in the current directory.

	./src
		/main
			/groovy
			/resources
		/test
			/groovy
			/resources

Note that both of these tasks will also generate a `build.gradle` file, and a `LICENSE.txt` file in their respective roots.

This results in this basic directory hierarchy:

	[project root]
		/src
			/main
				/groovy
				/resources
			/test
				/groovy
				/resources
		build.gradle
		LICENSE.txt

Which matches the default Gradle configuration.

## Installing for global use

Using [Gradle init scripts](http://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/init_scripts.html), it's possible to install the Templates plugin globally - Allowing you to execute `gradle createJavaProject` anywhere, even when there isn't a `build.gradle` file present in the directory.

Simply add the following to your `~/.gradle/init.gradle` script:

	gradle.beforeProject { prj ->
		prj.apply from: 'http://www.tellurianring.com/projects/gradle-plugins/gradle-templates/apply.groovy'
	}

A smaller quick start is available on [my blog](http://eric-berry.blogspot.com/2011/05/gradle-templates-plugin.html).

## Creating your own Project Templates

All the template plugins make use of the `ProjectTemplate` class. With it you can easy create your own tasks to generate your own files and directories.

### Creating a simpler Java project

Gradle defines a pretty standard configuration for a standard Java project. It's a directory structure that not only Gradle understands, but Maven understands as well. However, perhaps you don't need your project work this way, and you just want a very simple directory structure for your project.

Eg. Say we want a directory structure like so:

	[project root]
		/src
		/build.gradle

Where all our java classes simply go under the 'src' directory. Let's also say that you have a base package of `com.example`, so that all Java classes basically go under `src/com/example`.

Gradle already makes it very easy to change the default directory structure, so all we need is a new task to help us quickly generate the basic directory structures.

	import templates.*
	task 'createMyProject' << {
		String projectName = TemplatesPlugin.prompt('Project Name:')
		ProjectTemplate.fromRoot(projectName) {
			'src/com/example' {}
			'build.gradle' '''
			apply plugin: 'java'
			sourceSets {
				main {
					java {
						srcDir 'src'
					}
				}
			}
			'''
		}
	}
	
When you run `gradle createMyProject` now you'll be prompted for your new project's name, and then a new directory will be created based on that name.

The `import` statement simply imports the `TemplatesPlugin`, and `ProjectTemplate` classes into your build script.

We then create a new task named `createMyProject` which uses the `TemplatesPlugin.prompt` method to ask for the new project's name.

After that we use the `ProjectTemplate.fromRoot` method to start generating the required directories and files.

In this example we're creating just a single file `build.gradle` and using a multi-line string to pass the default contents.

You can also use a template, and parameters if you don't want the content to be directly in your build script.

For example, we could specify a default Java class template to be used when generating Java classes.

	package ${classPackage};
	
	/**
	* @author ${System.getProperty("user.name")}
	* Created: ${new Date()}
	*/
	public class ${className} {
		public ${className}() {
		}
	}

Here we create a new `GString` template file called `java-class.tmpl`. Which we use in a new `createJavaClass` task:

	task 'createJavaClass' << {
		String projectName = TemplatesPlugin.prompt('Project Name:')
		String className = TemplatesPlugin.prompt('Class Name:')
		ProjectTemplate.fromRoot(projectName) {
			'src/com/example' {
				"${className}.java" template: './java-class.tmpl',
						classPackage: 'com.example',
						className: className
			}
		}
	}

Executing `gradle createJavaClass` prompts us for our project name, and new Java class name. The class has the default package `com.example`, and our newly generated java file looks like this:

	package com.example;
	
	/**
	* @author elberry
	* Created: Mon Apr 18 12:45:30 PDT 2011
	*/
	public class MyClass {
		public MyClass() {
		
		}
	}

### Modifying default Template files

The Templates plugin comes with `GString` template files for all files generated through the tasks. These template files can be exported (Templates Plugin v1.1+) to the local file system and then customized to fit your needs.

##### Template file lookup

The Templates plugin will look for template files first by absolute path, then within the current working directory, and finally in the classpath.

Eg. The `java-templates` plugin uses the `/templates/java/java-class.tmpl` file to generate the new Java Class during the `createJavaClass` task execution.

The Templates plugin will first look on the file system for `/templates/java/java-class.tmpl`, then `./templates/java/java-class.tmpl`, and finally in the classpath for `/templates/java/java-class.tmpl`.

You can place your own `java-class.tmpl` file in either of the two file system locations and it'll override the default one provided in the templates.jar file.

##### Exporting template files (Templates Plugin v1.1+)

Run the `exportAllTemplates` to copy all templates files into the current working directory. This will create a subdirectory called `templates` containing all the .tmpl files. Each template plugin provides their own export task, eg. The 'java-templates' plugin provides the `exportJavaTemplates` task.

## Extra stuff

The TemplatesPlugin contains a few helpful methods and properties like the `prompt` method.

##### Properties

**group**: Can be used when defining tasks to have all template tasks grouped together.

	task "createJavaProject"(group: TemplatesPlugin.group) << { ... }

##### Methods

**prependPlugin**: Can be used in tasks to help add plugins to project build scripts.

	task "createJavaProject" << {
		...
		TemplatesPlugin.prependPlugin 'java', new File(projectName, "build.gradle")
	}

**prompt**: Can be used in tasks to prompt the user for some input.

	task "favoriteColor" << {
		String color = TemplatesPlugin.prompt("What is your favorite color?")
		println "Your favorite color is ${color}"
	}

Also takes a default value.

	task "favoriteColor" << {
		String color = TemplatesPlugin.prompt("What is your favorite color?", "Green")
		println "Your favorite color is ${color}"
	}

**promptOptions**: Can be used to prompt the user for a choice of 1 of a list of options.

	task "bestColor" << {
		def colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]
		int choice = TemplatesPlugin.promptOptions("Which color do you like best?", colors)
		println "You like ${colors[choice]} best."
	}

Or you can pass in a default value:

	// Default value is 1 based - matches the numeric values displayed to the user.
	task "bestColor" << {
		def colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]
		int choice = TemplatesPlugin.promptOptions("Which color do you like best?", 1, colors)
		println "You like ${colors[choice]} best."
	}

**promptYesOrNo**: Can be used in tasks to prompt for boolean 'yes', or 'no' answers.

	task "useful" << {
		if(TemplatesPlugin.promptYesOrNo("Is the templates plugin useful to you?")) {
			println "Great! I'm glad to hear that!"
		} else {
			println "Awww, I'm sorry to hear that."
		}
	}

### Gradle Properties for tasks

The Templates tasks are listed below with the available `-P` properties. Supplying the `-P` properties on the command line will avoid being prompted for the values during task execution.
